# Credit Risk Estimation
I did a project on Analytics Vidhya in which my objective was to predict whether a loan applicant will receive a loan or not based on the data pertaining to the applicant. Firstly, I analyzed the data, cleaned it and then applied various Machine learning algorithms on it out of which I got the maximum accuracy by applying Logistic regression model. I scored accuracy of about 83.14%.I did the project on Jupyter notebook using Python.
